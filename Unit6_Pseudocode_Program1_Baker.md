## Unit 6 Assignment Plan : Charles Baker

### Scenario
  - Need to sort an array with a large number of account balances in ascending order.

### Variable Declarations
  - int[] accountBalances
  - bool swapped
  - int temp

### Input
  - Input account balances from accounts.h

### Processing
  - Step through the array comparing values and swapping them if i > i + 1 for ASC and i < i + 1 for DESC

### Output
  - Output the sorted array to console and the result of cpuTime to Results.txt

### Error Conditions
  - Input is coming from a predefined array and not a user so we shouldn't need data validation.
